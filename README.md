# FDG

Force-Directed-Graph software design tool.

Currently under development, so the docs are a little light, as you can tell...

Also note, this was a 4 hour port of a project to work on an improved interface, written from my seat in coach on an airplane. There is a lot not checked in, and I'm going to be abandoning knockout and doing some significant adjustments, so please be patient.

## Setting up and running

```sh
npm install
node .
# navigate to http://localhost:4242
```
